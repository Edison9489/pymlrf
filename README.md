# Python Machine Learning Research Framework (PyMLRF)

PyMLRF is a general framework to aid with research projects developing and applying machine learning algorithms. The package will implement:
- Classes for handling file systems
- Training and validation loops for Pytorch as well as for more specific frameworks including d3rlpy
- Integration with weights and biases
